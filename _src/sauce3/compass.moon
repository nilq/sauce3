-- User input from compass (works only on mobile devices).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Some Android devices and iOS devices have an integrated magnetic field
-- sensor that provides information on how the device is oriented with respect
-- to the magnetic north pole.
--
-- ***Note =*** The compass is currently not available on iOS devices since
-- there is no implementation in the RoboVM - backend yet.

-- Get the angle of the device's orientation around the x-axis. The positive

---
